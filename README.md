# SoberFriends

SoberFriends aims to help people quit their addiction by tracking their progress, and having a community of people going through the same thing for support.

## Motivation

I wanted to build an app for people going through quitting their addiction, because I know when you are quitting it can be tough to stay motivated. Also some people may feel like they are alone and have no support. This app aims to solve that by having a community, as well as allowing the user to see their progress by tracking how much money they have saved and how many days they have been stopped their addiction for.
